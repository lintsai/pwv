Password Validation Service

## Instructions

Write a password validation service, meant to be configurable via IoC (using dependency
injection engine of your choice). The service is meant to check a text string for compliance
to any number of password validation rules. The rules currently known are:

* Must consist of a mixture of lowercase letters and numerical digits only, with at least one
of each.
* Must be between 5 and 12 characters in length.
* Must not contain any sequence of characters immediately followed by the same sequence.

For any questions or clarifications, please email us back and weâ€™ll get back to you as soon as
we can.

Include all artifacts in a zip file and please let us know how many hours you spent on the
programming problem. The project should include a build capability in one of the following
tools, Eclipse, IntelliJ, ant, or maven. The project should be ready for insertion into a
production system. Show tests for the service and any constituent classes involved in
fulfillment of the service. Also, show how to access and use the service at runtime.

## Keys

* Read the requirements, read them again
* Professional quality work is important, should be a solution you are proud of
* Take your time and avoid sloppy mistakes caused by rushing
* SOLID design principles
* Apply sensible design patterns
* Use dependency injection in a sensible way given the problem
* Solution should be extensible
* Solution should be maintainable
* Automated test should fully exercise the code and prove it works
* Show both unit tests and integration tests
* Apply the same design principles to the test code that you apply to the actual code
* Ask questions, confirm your understanding
